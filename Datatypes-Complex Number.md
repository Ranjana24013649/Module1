# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
x=int(input(''))

y=int(input(''))

x=complex(x,y)

print(x)

print(x.real)

print(x.imag)


## Output

![438596007-d58e4050-9f89-4516-9c8a-e12c98cefcd7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342b7551-85a2-478e-b888-974c6da3f948)



## Result

Thus, the program as been executed successfully.
